Erin Zomer-Wieferich How exactly does a radar "gun" effectively guage speed...must you be stopped or does it work against oncoming traffic while you are in motion?

Shepherd Police Department Most people are not aware of this, but after everyone takes their piece of the "ticket pie" the individual department might get $15 or 20 of that money...so issuing tickets is definitely not any type of significant money maker.

Laura Brian Cokonougher Can anyone including police officers shoot my dogs if they are licensed in my fenced in yard for barking or being protective of my property?

Laura Brian Cokonougher My dogs are not mean. Only if you hit me will they be protective and then they will just try to push you away.

Shepherd Police Department Why would we shoot them? That's not how we solve a barking dog call. We only use force against a dog if it attacks us.

Laura Brian Cokonougher Our neighbors keep telling us that if they call the cop on our dogs you will shot them. It's their dogs that start our dogs barking. They hear theirs outside dogs barking and have to run out side to see what's going on I didn't think so. I think we make them nervous because they do illegal stuff down there that's why they threaten us all the time with that so we won't call the cops.

Shepherd Police Department It would be okay to pass if you are in a passing zone.

Miriam Drozd So chippewa st you'd just have to wait til they turned or something because that road has 2 solid yellow lines. Just clarifying.

Jeremy Claybaugh Is there a law against those auxiliary lights that people are putting on their vehicles? I have come across so many that are on going down the road and they are blinding bright.

Shepherd Police Department Lighting is one that has many different interpretations. It is illegal if it causes visual impairment or is distracting to other drivers...but that is obviously very subjective. A lot of factory installed lights on vehicles are SO bright, that you often think someone has their brights on and it is actually their dims.

Gene Rhinehart So if a person were to have one and had them on and just turned it off as if they were brights when approaching another vehicle, would that be ok??

Shepherd Police Department No idea. The issue is that when it's 70mph, people go 75 or 80. If it is moved to 75mph...people will go 80 or 85.

Shepherd Police Department I think for most officers it is the variety of each day, rarely do you have a day that's not different. Also the fact that the day can go from zero to 100 in a split second. Lastly, the ability to help people in their time of need.
