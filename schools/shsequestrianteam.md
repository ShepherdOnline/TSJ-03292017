There was a meeting on Sunday, March 26th inside the Shepherd Maple Room for high school students who were interested in joining. Fundraisers and an upcoming show were going to be discussed.

## Discussion

Did you attend the meeting? I'm interested in sharing a follow up story about the meeting, and sharing any news there is for the Equestrian team in the future. Respond in the comments, contact me on Facebook, or send an email to editor@shepherdhistory.org if you have questions or want to pass along information.

A story I could run would be about who the members of the team will be, and a list of important dates.
