# Stay Aware of Your Surroundings

Hey everyone! With all over the news about people leaving creepy things on people's windshields and items tied to car antennas, this is the perfect opportunity to discuss the most basic and I believe the most important safety measure you can take and that is...BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS. If you were expecting something more exciting, cool or tactical...it all boils down to awareness.

I'm not saying that anyone who has been a victim of the recent events did anything wrong, so please don't read that into it. I'm also not saying that being aware will automatically put a "forcefield" around you and you'll be exempt from any type of trouble. One more things...the importance of awareness is not just for females, it is just as important for males too.

When you park at a store, do you look around and see what is lurking outside of your vehicle before you exit it? Is it just the store employee rounding up shopping carts...or is it someone that creeps you out and could be looking to do you harm? Or do you just get out and have no idea who or what is near?

When you are walking down the sidewalk, into a restaurant, store, etc. are you aware of what is around you or are you consumed with your phone (I'm not pointing fingers, because I have been guilty too)? Just this morning I saw a person walk into a shopping cart...in the middle of the parking lot, because they were staring at their phone. We have all seen the person almost ran over walking into a store because they are preoccupied.
I'm not saying that you have to be paranoid leaving your house, simply that knowing who and what potential dangers around you exist is a great start in keeping you safe. Walk strong and confident!

Have a great weekend!
